I did testing with my friend who works with technology in her job but not heavily or in any development aspect.

I showed her the wireframes for a couple minutes and said don't ask any questions at this point. Then I gave hypothetical roles for her to play given the background of the website as a design agency.

The roles were:

1. Potential client who wants to see who company has worked with in the past:


2. Potential client wants to get in touch with someone specific from the company


3. Person wanting to start a partnership with the company


4. Someone wants to apply to work with us:

It was pretty simple given the pretty simple layout I've put together as a one-page scroll. She had an easy time finding everything. I learned though that she doesn't really like forms. I asked what would be better for her, she wasn't really sure, but she thought having social media buttons or a way to email people directly or a phone number might be better, so that's definitely something to consider is to have multiple entry points, depending on the business.

She also said it was kind of nice having everything on one page, with the exception of the portfolio items. That could indicate having the least amount of pages possible without making it too cluttered may be a good strategy.
