The reading on the accessibility on forms helped clarify a few things for me. One was the importance and distinction between 'id' and 'name' on forms and after using the HTML validator I knew what I had to change on the form. I made sure the 'label for' matched the 'id' for every form field. I also learned about a couple different things that I hadn't thought about, like specifying the alt tag if I were to use an image as a button and the javascript jump menus. I also learned about some accessibility issues on multi-select menus and learned how to create optgroups in option menus. This was a succinct and informational reading. It is definitely getting bookmarked for future reference.
