This reading has been enlightening to the fact it points out forms are typically a gate-keeper so to speak between users and organizations goals. Working in a sales/marketing function in the past with a SaaS organization, I could see the impact form fill outs could have for sales forecasts, sales personnel actually having jobs, marketing teams having accurate metrics and just making an overall huge impact on an organization. This highlights the usability in a couple ways. One is that forms shouldn't be a massive distraction and be so distasteful that a user who might have been looking for a b2b solution, rather go elsewhere because the form just was too much of a hassle. The other is that if the information isn't validated and the right information isn't collected and passed accurately and efficiently, entire sales and marketing teams are essentially spinning their wheels and getting zero traction due to the bad information collected on forms.

It's also interesting to think about forms as conversations between users and organizations. I think approaching the dev from that point of view makes the success of it more based on a psychological and human approach more than merely technical ability.

Things I've changed since reading this:
1. change submit button to be specific.
2. I added a reset button less prominent than the submit.
3. I changed what the input labels said to be more conversational
4. I linked bootstrap to bring in some bootstrap styling but keep the original css intact.
5. I made the website not required.
